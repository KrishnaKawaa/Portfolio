# Portfolio
I built a responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, incorporating custom JavaScript functionality to enhance interactivity. The project showcases my skills, highlights completed projects, and provides an engaging user experience with clean, modern design elements and smooth animations.
